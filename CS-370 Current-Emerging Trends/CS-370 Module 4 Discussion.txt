Hi everyone. I decided to try and use the board game checkers. I figure everyone knows it and it is fairly simple. The starting state of checkers is always the same. Each player has 3 rows of 4 pieces all on the same color squares. The end state can vary in where pieces are, but the game ends when one player doesn't have any pieces left or can't move. There is also a possibility of a draw when noone wins. Actions involved in the game are a normal piece has to move forward diagnal or jump an opponent piece forward diagnal. When you get a piece to the opponents back row the piece becomes a king. A king can move or jump any diagnal. Winning or losing the game would have the biggest reward / penalty at +/-25. Jumping a piece would have a reward / penalty of +/- 2. Having your piece kinged would be a reward of +5. The last thing would be a penalty of -.2 per turn to try and teach it to be efficient. 
My approach and the Markov Decision Process are similar in a few ways. They both have states, actions, and rewards. The difference is that in the Markov Decision Process there are transition probabilities that represent uncertaintly in the actions taken and discount factor which has a preference for smaller rewards right now than larger unknown rewards later. This may mean it never goes for the win with big points and takes a medium amount of points instead.
