I read the article: Reptile: A scalable meta-learning algorithm. It was a little over my head but the main point of it was that Reptile is used for meta-learning for neural networks. It basically trains a neural network to use way less training data and to be able to easily train on different problems. It actually had the code for an example in the article so I tried it out and although it's not really comparing apples to apples, compared to the code that we were using for training neural networks with 60,000 images it was blazing fast, like less than a second and it was done, since it only used 10 points on a sin line to train over 30,000 iterations (OpenAI 2018).
A key advantage of meta-learned systems is their flexibility and potential for fast adaptation from little data. This can help to overcome many drawbacks of traditional machine learning algorithms, such as the need for large datasets, high training costs, substantial efforts due to many training trials and the necessity for extensive hyperparameter tuning, and long training times (Macdonald 2023). The approach is applicable to a variety of problems—including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning—and can be combined with any model architecture, as long as the model is trained based on gradient descent. Ethically, it alleviates the need to collect vast amounts of data, and is therefore applicable where supervised training examples are difficult (or even impossible) to acquire (given safety, security and privacy issues). If training efficient deep learning models is possible in such a scenario with just a handful of examples, it will benefit machine learning practitioners and meta-learning’s overall adoption (Cloudera 2020). It seems like the real disadvantage of meta-learning is the same as its advantage. If you have a generalized neural network it will be ok at solving everything, but not great at solving anything specialized.
