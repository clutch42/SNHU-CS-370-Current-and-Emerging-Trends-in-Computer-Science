## Projects
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? We were given most of the code for this project including the TreasureMaze and GameExperience classes. What we actually created was the training loop for the deep Q-learning algorithm.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? Computer scientists, in particular in the field of AI, develop algorithms that allow for machine learning. This can help with real world productivity, efficiency, and automation.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? The first thing to do as a computer scientist is to identify and understand the problem that needs to be solved, including inputs and desired outputs. Then break down the problem into smaller, managable parts if needed. Then create a solution to the problem by focusing on the smaller parts and the users requirements. While coding I test each part as I am creating it to make sure it functions properly. Finally I take the finished product and make sure it still meets the requirements of the user.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? My ethical responsibilities to the end user are to protect their information, and in the case of AI, to write algorithms that are as fair and unbiased as possible. For the organization, I need to develop according to their specifications, while making sure to adhere to any laws regarding AI or the particular application I am developing.
